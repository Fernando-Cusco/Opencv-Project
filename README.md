# Opencv-Project
Final Project IA2
# Application developed in C++
In this application is performing to recognition objects.
### Hi there, We are Fernando Cusco and Ruben Abad👋
## We are  a Students, Classmates and Developer!
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a Text editor
- 🔭 He is currently working on a CLion
- 🌱 We are currently learning everything 🤣
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate with other content creators
- 🥅 2020 Goals: Contribute more to Open Source projects

### Modules utilized :
#### COLOR_BGR2Lab:
L* for the lightness from black (0) to white (100), a* from green (−) to red (+), and b* from blue (−) to yellow (+).
This outputs 0≤L≤100, −127≤a≤127, −127≤b≤127 . The values are then converted to the destination data type:
•	8-bit images: L←L∗255/100,a←a+128,b←b+128
•	16-bit images: (currently not supported)
•	32-bit images: L, a, and b are left as is

#### CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization):
So to solve this problem, adaptive histogram equalization is used. In this, image is divided into small blocks called "tiles" (tileSize is 8x8 by default in OpenCV). Then each of these blocks are histogram equalized as usual. So in a small area, histogram would confine to a small region (unless there is noise). If noise is there, it will be amplified. To avoid this, contrast limiting is applied. If any histogram bin is above the specified contrast limit (by default 40 in OpenCV), those pixels are clipped and distributed uniformly to other bins before applying histogram equalization.

#### Matches:
Helps us to draw the matches. It stacks two images horizontally and draws the lines from the first image to second image showing, best matches.

#### Surf:
OpenCV provides SURF functionalities just like SIFT. You initiate a SURF object with some optional conditions like 64/128-dim descriptors, Upright/Normal SURF etc. All the details are well explained in docs. Then as we did in SIFT, we can use SURF.detect(), SURF.compute() etc for finding keypoints and descriptors.
#### BFMarcher:
Brute-Force matcher is simple. It takes the descriptor of one feature in first set and is matched with all other features in second set using some distance calculation.
#### Hu momnets:
Image moments are a weighted average of image pixel intensities.
#### Medianeblur
The function smoothes an image using the median filter with the  aperture. Each channel of a multi-channel image is processed independently. In-place operation is supported.
## Running of the Application ⚙️
Now we will perform the obejct recognition, first we'll(we will) do it one at a time, then two by two, and lastly, three at a time.

### Doing to Testing end-to-end 🔩
Now we will perform the obejct recognition, first we'll(we will) do it one at a time, then two by two, and lastly, three at a time.

## Conclusion ✒️
Overall, after working and implementing certain libraries, some of which are used for image processing and such as figures, colors and pixels and so on. In modern applications, since functionality is a key element, rapidly increasing demand for such tools such as:
•	Facial Recognition
•	Recognition and Identification based on categorization such as colors, shapes and so on.
